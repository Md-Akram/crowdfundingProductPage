## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The biggest learning for me is learning how to create modals. Besides I learned few CSS tricks.

Implementing JS to open and close the nav, show and hide the modal and success modal was also a relatively new thing.
